Welcome! 

**The living book of Marshall** was born from the idea of producing content based on the concept of open science. It is important to be clear that this book is not peer-reviewed. At least not in the traditional way. The content of this book includes a series of notes on topics of interest to me. Topics that I have been working on in my day-to-day life as a researcher in the areas of biomaterials, bioinformatics, data science, and bone regeneration biology.\
As you read this book you will probably come across some incomplete section. Don't worry, this is part of the idea of a living book. This book will never have a final version. I will try to add sections as I go deeper and believe it is important to share them with the community.\
