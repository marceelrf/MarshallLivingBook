# (PART\*) R programming {.unnumbered}

# R basics {#rprog}

The R language was developed for data analysis with a solid statistical background. R is a multi-paradigm object-oriented, functional programming, dynamic, weakly typed, programming language focused on data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. It was originally created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in the Statistics department at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. The Base R packages are developed and maintained by the R Development Core Team (R Core), through their controlled Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). All source code is available for review under the Free Software Foundation's GNU Public License (GPL). You can download in the Comprehensive R Archive Network ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)) website.

There are several development interfaces for programming with R, but among all of them I strongly recommend using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). You can work with in Windows, Mac, and Linux, or through a web browser using the RStudio server, if you want.
