# About {.unnumbered}

**The living book of Marshall** was born from the idea of producing content based on the concept of open science. It is important to be clear that this book is not peer-reviewed. At least not in the traditional way. The content of this book includes a series of notes on topics of interest to me. Topics that I have been working on in my day-to-day life as a researcher in the areas of biomaterials, bioinformatics, data science, and bone regeneration biology.\
As you read this book you will probably come across some incomplete section. Don't worry, this is part of the idea of a living book. This book will never have a final version. I will try to add sections as I go deeper and believe it is important to share them with the community.\

## About me {-}

![It's mee!](images/marshall.jpg)

I'm a brazilian medical physicist with master in Biotechnology and currently a PhD candidate (Biotechnology) at SÃ£o Paulo State University ([UNESP](https://unesp.br/)). On April 2022 I joined the Witek Lab at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) as a visiting schoolar. I'm currently working on the development of tools for bone biomaterials analysis, focusing on alternative methods to animal testing. I have interest in biological databases, bioinfomatics analysis, data science, machine learning and new technologies as 3D bioprinting and organ-on-a-chip. I am an enthusiast of open science and the R programming language. Right now I am preparing the documentation for my first package!\
